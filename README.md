# Minimalist-Personal-Website

This is a minimalist personal portfolio website for showcasing development projects. It's designed to be very quick and simple to set up, following a minimalist style both in design and structure.

1. Features
* Responsive design with a clean layout.
* Easy to navigate sections (About Me, Projects, Experience, Blog, Contact).
* Simple, modern UI using Lato font from Google Fonts.
* Customizable social media icons in the header and footer.

2. Getting Started & Prerequisites
  * To set up the project, you'll need the following:
    * A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
    * A basic text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text to modify the code if necessary.

3. Installation
* Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git

* Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the site locally.

4. Customization
You can modify the following to personalize the site for your use:
* Text content: Modify the text within the index.html file to suit your bio, projects, and experiences.
* Images: Replace me.jpg with your own image in the intro section. Be sure to name the new image me.jpg or update the path in the HTML.
* Social links: Update the <a href=""> attributes for the social media icons in both the header and footer to link to your actual social profiles.

5. Styles
* The site uses a CSS file (styles.css) for all styling. Customize the webpage to your liking through this file.

6. **System-Specific Adjustments**
Some parts of the setup may be specific to your system or require additional adjustments:
* Google Fonts: The site uses Lato from Google Fonts. Ensure you have internet access or download the fonts locally if you're working offline. Modify the @import line in the CSS as needed.
* Image Paths: If you encounter issues with images not showing, ensure the image paths in your HTML (img src="me.jpg") match your local file structure. You can modify the src attribute to reflect the correct path if it's different on your machine.

**Disclaimer**
This project is intentionally minimalistic, aimed to be quick to set up and finish. It's primarily designed as a starting point for a personal developer portfolio. Feel free to add more sections, pages, or styling as needed to suit your preferences.
